Just a small shell like tool which is supposed to give some low level features too. first u give the command, then the options, then the arguments for the options then it runs and thats it. the syntax is a bit rigid but the tool itself is supposed to flexible in its function. The tool itself is far from finished and most of my commits are just small commits it self so yeah.If you wonna join then i would be more than happy to make u join this project. file of modes consist of the names of each option and those names are separated using &. and the syntax for giving the command is :
command1_argv1&command1_argv2&and so one| command2_argv1&command2_argv2& and so on.

then u give the options which has the same syntax which is :
command1_option1&command1_option2&and so one| command2_option1&command2_option2& and so on.
then u give arguments which is the same.


FIRST ARGUMENT IS FOR OPTION 2 while the SECOND ARGUMENT IS FOR OPTION 3.

ARGUMENTS FOR EACH PROGRAM IS OBVIOUSLY DIVIDED BY THE SAME |

OBVIOUSLY ARGUMENTS MAY FURTHUR PROCESS AND INPUT BASED ON A SPECIFIC ENCOUNTER OF A STRING OR A CHARACTOR.
